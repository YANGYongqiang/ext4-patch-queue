This patch series did 5 things:

-- prevent parallel resizer

-- fix some bugs and typos
   there are dome bugs and typos in current resize implementation

-- rearrange code used by current resize
   so that common code could be used by new resize

-- let current resize be able to handle BLOCK_UNINIT group
   This can accelerate resizing

-- add new resize implementation
   new-resize can support flex_bg and BLOCK_UNINIT, and adds a flex groups
   each time, so it is very fast.
